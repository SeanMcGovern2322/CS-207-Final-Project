### Showcase 

For this project I turned an infant's highchair into a musical toy using some lights, a few arcade buttons, a paizo buzzer, and an Arduino Uno.  When the child pushes one of the arcade button the buzzer will play one of the songs selected from the musicbuzzer library and then play a Larson Scanner pattern across the lights.
