### Showcase 

For this project I turned an infant's highchair into a musical toy using some lights, a few arcade buttons, a paizo buzzer, and an Arduino Uno.  When the child pushes one of the arcade button the buzzer will play one of the songs selected from the musicbuzzer library and then play a Larson Scanner pattern across the lights.

### Manifest
1. Circuit Diagram - Final Project.fzz, a basic diagram of the circuit, showing the components and how they are wired up.  Drawn in the fritzing software.
2. Final_project_Code.ino, the code of the project, managing how all the components of the build function.  Writting in the Arduino Software (IDE).
3. README.md, the readme file you are currently reading. Details the process of the build, it's purpose, and it's issues.  Writting in Github.
